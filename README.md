# Gastroenteric Diagnostical Expert System
>A knowledge-based system for diagnosing gastroenteric illnesses created in 2023 as a project for my Knowledge Engineering and Management course in the British University in Dubai.

>Python was used in this project.

> A decision tree was used as the main functionality to find the diagnosis based on symptoms.

> The application is presented in a form of a questionnaire.

>A GUI is used to display the input and the output of the program.

## Methodology

> To test the functionality of using a knowledge-based expert system in healthcare, a simple
application was developed. After choosing a medical discipline that can utilize an expert
system to automate a diagnosis, a decision tree was researched and created. Decision trees are
particularly useful in expert systems because they provide a clear and intuitive way of
representing the decision-making process. Gastroenterology was chosen for the development
of the expert system because of how underutilized technology is in the discipline.

> Python was used as the main methodology utilized in for the implementation of the
Gastroenteric Diagnostical Expert System. Using the Tkinter package in Python, the
graphical user interface was created. Tkinter is a Python library that enables developers to
create graphical user interfaces for desktop applications. Tkinter provides a comprehensive
set of tools for building graphical user interfaces that include various interactive elements
such as buttons, menus, text boxes, and more. The decision tree was implemented using
switch statements and a score-based system. Each node in the decision tree is represented
using a numerical value. That numerical value is used in switch statements to decide the state
of the program. By pressing on the “Yes” or “No” buttons, the score increases which allows
the user to navigate through the decision tree. The labels in the program changes on whether
a question or a diagnosis is being displayed. Once a diagnosis is reached, the buttons are
removed from the form to make it easier for the diagnosis to be displayed. The minimalistic
design with the intuitive functionality was used to create a more polished end product.
